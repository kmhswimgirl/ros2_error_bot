# ros2_error_bot
A discord bot that lurks in my personal server and replies with weird ROS error messages.

## Features
- responds to ROS Noetic references (i.e. rosrun)
- will reply with a random ROS error message when 'ros' is typed

## Future Features
- Other noetic references are supported (roslaunch, rosdoctor, roswtf)
- yaml config files
- commands
